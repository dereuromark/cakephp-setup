# CakePHP Setup Plugin Documentation

## Version notice

This branch only works for **CakePHP 4.x**

## Installation
* [Installation](Install.md)

## Detailed Documentation - Quicklinks
* [Maintenance Mode](Maintenance/Maintenance.md)
* [Setup Component](Component/Setup.md)
* [Setup Web Backend](Controller/Setup.md)
* [Useful Setup Commands](Console/Commands.md)

## Bake Templates Deluxe
The highly advanced bake templates have been further enhanced and are part of this plugin.
The defaults go well together with the Tools plugin, Bootstrap3+ and some other useful defaults.
You can also just steal ideas, of course ;)
* [Setup plugin Bake templates](Console/Bake.md)

## Useful debugging help
The following are convenience wrappers to debug safely. They will only show output with debug true.

* dd($data) = debug() + die() // This is now also in CakePHP 3.3+ directly :-)
* prd($data) = pr() + die()
* vd() = var_dump()
* vdd($data) = var_dump() + die()

They are available when you include the plugin's bootstrap at Plugin::load().

## Testing
You can test using a local installation of phpunit or the phar version of it:

    cd .../cakephp-setup
    composer install // or: php composer.phar install
    composer test-setup
    composer test

To test a specific file:

    php phpunit.phar /path/to/MyClass.php

To test MySQL specific tests, run this before (you might have to adjust your connection details):
```
export DB_URL="mysql://root:secret@127.0.0.1/cake_test"
```
By default the tests use an SQLite DB.

## Tips

Import Huge SQL file:

    ...\bin\mysql -u root dbname < dumpfilename.sql

Same other direction:

    ...\bin\mysqldump -h host -u root -p dbname > dumpfilename.sql
